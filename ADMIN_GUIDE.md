  // Financial
  walletBalance, accountLimits
  
  // KYC tracking
  kycStatus, kycDocuments, kycTimestamps
  
  // Security
  riskScore, loginCount, deviceInfo, ipAddress
  
  // Admin controls
  isAdmin, isActive, isSuspended, suspensionReason
}
```

### Mock Data Store
- Simulates database operations
- Provides CRUD operations for users, transactions, KYC
- Maintains audit trail of admin actions
- Calculates real-time statistics

## üéØ Best Practices

### For User Management
1. **Regular Review**: Check high-risk users weekly
2. **Prompt KYC**: Process KYC requests within 24-48 hours
3. **Clear Communication**: Provide specific rejection reasons
4. **Audit Trail**: Document all administrative decisions

### For KYC Verification
1. **Document Quality**: Ensure clear, readable documents
2. **Identity Matching**: Verify name matches across documents
3. **Expiry Dates**: Check document validity periods
4. **Fraud Detection**: Look for signs of document tampering

### For Risk Management
1. **Monitor Patterns**: Watch for unusual transaction patterns
2. **Gradual Limits**: Increase limits as users build trust
3. **Regular Updates**: Recalculate risk scores periodically
4. **Escalation Process**: Have clear procedures for high-risk cases

## üîê Security Considerations
